# Tansport-api-Bratislava

This is a simple API created in Python using Flask that serves as part of one of my projects. The API unifies several existing interfaces, including MHD in Bratislava, Tier Scooters, Svišť Scooters, Slovnaft Bajk, Rekola, and Blinke, to make this data easier to access for other developers. The project is designed to improve awareness and ease of working with public transport and shared asset data for the development of applications and services.
